# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Juno! 
I've created this github to collect the projects I've made and will make throughout my programming journey ðŸ˜Š

### ðŸ‘€ Interests
- I'm a fan of art, and I make it from time to time ðŸŒ¹
- I really enjoy puzzle solving, which is one thing that I love about programming, it's all a big puzzle, and finding the solution is super satisfying ðŸ”†
- I really like gaming, which was my gateway into tech ðŸŽ²
- I also love nature and science ðŸ¦ 

### ðŸ“« How to Reach Me
- Email: [green161104@gmail.com](mailto:green161104@gmail.com)

### ðŸ˜„ Pronouns
- Any pronouns are okay!
  
### âš¡ Fun Fact
- During college, on more than one occasion, I've found myself coming up with solutions to problems I've had whilst developing, in my dreams. This has made me promptly get up at 4-5am in order to implement the solutions bestowed upon me by my dreams.
